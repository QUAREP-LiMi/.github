## QUAREP-LiMi

Welcome to the QUAREP-LiMi github page.
QUAREP-LiMi is a group of enthusiastic light microscopists from Academia and Industry all interested in improving quality assessment (QA) and quality control (QC) in light microscopy. We came together in our first online Web meeting on 28th of April, 2020 with about 50 attendees. By now (19th of September 2023) the group has grown to 554 people from 39 countries all over the world. We have members from national microscopy communities, companies involved in the microscopy business, organizations or institutions related to standardization on a national or international level, and scientific publishers and observers from funding agencies
